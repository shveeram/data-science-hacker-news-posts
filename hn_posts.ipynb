    "# Ask HN vs Show HN posts: Hacker News Engagement analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we look at the popular technology news site [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), and analyse the posts with the titles that begin with either Ask HN or Show HN.\n",
    "\n",
    "<mark>Ask HN</mark> posts are the ones that users submit to ask the community a specific question, while, <mark>Show HN</mark> posts are the ones they submit to show the community a project, product, or something interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will compare the two types of posts to determine:\n",
    "- Which receive more comments on average?\n",
    "- Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset for this project can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts). Below are the description of the columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <mark>id</mark>:  unique identifier from Hacker News for the post\n",
    "- <mark>title</mark>: the title of the post\n",
    "- <mark>url</mark>: the URL that the posts link to (if it has a URL)\n",
    "- <mark>num_points</mark>: the number of points the post acquired, calculated as the total number of upvotes minus the total number of downvotes\n",
    "- <mark>num_comments</mark>: the number of comments on the post\n",
    "- <mark>author</mark>: the username of the person who submitted the post\n",
    "- <mark>created_at</mark>: the date and time of the post's submission (the time zone is *US Eastern Time*)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: This dataset is based on approximately 20,000 rows randomly sampled from the submissions after removing posts without any comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's read the dataset and display some posts.\n",
