    "# Hacker news: Analysis of posts\n",
    "\n",
    "## About:\n",
    "Hacker news is a website extremely populer in technology and startup circles. User-submitted stories (known as \"posts\") are voted and commented upon by the site visitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're specifically interested in posts whose titles begin with either **`Ask HN`** or **`Show HN`**. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Users submit **`Ask HN`** posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question.\n",
    "* Users submit **`Show HN`** posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal:\n",
    "Our goal in this project is:\n",
    "   1. To compare the *Ask* and *Show* posts of the Hacker news data set and see which of the two receive most comments?\n",
    "   2. To perform an analysis based on certain time the post was made to determine if that had a bearing on higher comments made for the post?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data set:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data set for this project can be download from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The data set has been reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that did not receive any comments, and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are descriptions of the columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `id`: The unique identifier from Hacker News for the post\n",
    "* `title`: The title of the post\n",
    "* `url`: The URL that the posts links to, if it the post has a URL\n",
    "* `num_points`: The number of points the post acquired, calculated as the total number of upvotes minus the total number of downvotes\n",
    "* `num_comments`: The number of comments that were made on the post\n",
    "* `author`: The username of the person who submitted the post\n",
    "* `created_at`: The date and time at which the post was submitted\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, let's look at a few rows from the data set to understand the how its presented."
